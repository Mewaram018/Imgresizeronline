            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                At imagetool.com, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Our platform is designed to process your images securely without collecting, storing, or sharing any data. Below is an in-depth explanation of our privacy practices:
            </p>
            <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
            <p>
                We do not collect or store any images, personal data, or metadata uploaded by users. All image processing occurs either locally in your browser or on secure servers, ensuring that no data is retained. This policy applies to all past, present, and future interactions with our platform.
            </p>
            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                To support our services, we display advertisements from trusted third-party platforms, such as Google Ads. These advertisements are managed entirely by the respective platforms, and we do not share or provide any user data to them. Ads are tailored based on non-personalized, contextual information.
            </p>
            <h2>Security Measures</h2>
            <p>
                Our website employs industry-standard encryption and secure communication protocols to ensure that your interactions are safe and private. By processing images without storing them, we minimize risks associated with data breaches or misuse.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                As a user, you have complete control over your data. Since we do not store any data, there is no need for data deletion requests. Your images remain your own, and we make no claims of ownership or usage rights.
            </p>
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>
